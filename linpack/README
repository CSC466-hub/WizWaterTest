This is Intel-optimized Linpack version 11.1.2.005 from
http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-math-kernel-library-linpack-download

To run the tests: enter the command sudo bash doit.sh
This will run the native and docker versions 20 times for each CPU configuration.
Note that running linpack 1 time means 10 tests. If you attempt to run it 20 times you will have 200 tests.
Linpack tests take a long amount of time and 200 tests could take days.

If you wish to only run a specific test, you can directly run the scripts.
Either script must be followed by a number, 1 or 2.

Choose option 1 for one sockets (--physcpubind=0-7,16-23 --localalloc)
Choose option 2 for two sockets (--physcpubind=0-31 --interleave=0,1)



VM
    ./vm.sh

Docker
    docker build -t linpack .

This is a SAMPLE run script for SMP LINPACK. Change it to reflect
the correct number of CPUs/threads, problem input files, etc..
