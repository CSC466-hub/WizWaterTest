using an ubuntu 13.10 container with fixed sources.list has issue:
libgomp.so.1: version `GOMP_4.0' not found (required by /stream.exe)
this is because ubuntu 13 doesn't have acces to gomp4, which was included in gcc 4.9+
ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test doesn't have anything beyond gcc 4.8 for ubuntu 13

change this to ubuntu 18.04 same as base image
